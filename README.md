# Restricted Replies Plugin

This plugin adds a per-category setting allowing staff to restrict replies in a certain category to the OP, and members of specific groups. This is a bolt-on to the core permissions system, and is configured using a separate UI underneath the regular category security settings.

You may want to use this to create a support category where all users can ask questions, but only users in the "experts" group can post replies.
